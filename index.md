## Emma Cooper's First CS193 Homework

- in two weeks of the 100 minutes of class scheduled, we've only had 15
- the instructors seem very friendly and approachable
- the class is designed to help me and not just throw ridiculous amounts of work at me
- that's about all I can think of because it's only been two weeks but hopefully the class will provide me with more things to like
